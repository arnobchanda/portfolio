Hi👋, I am Arnob. Welcome!  
I am an embedded firmware/software engineer from India.

In my day job, I work mostly with low level languages like **C**.  
In addition to that, bunch of **Bash** and **Python** as my primary scripting languages.  
Also **Docker**, if I want to containerize anything.

I love tinkering with both hardware and software systems.  
I own 2 Rpi5 and 3 Rpi4B+. Yes, they are getting used for different things.  
One of them is even hosting this app.

Recently, I have been tinkering with AI too.  
Playing with ollama, n8n automations, trying to create my own RAG, etc etc.
